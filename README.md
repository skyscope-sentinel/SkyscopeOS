# SkyScope Sentinel OS - The Ultimate AGI

## Overview
SkyScope Sentinel OS is a revolutionary, fully autonomous, locally hosted AGI orchestration system designed to transform a standard Debian-based operating system into a first-of-its-kind self-aware, self-mutating AI OS. It integrates a suite of advanced capabilities to create a single, cohesive, and incredibly powerful digital entity.

## Core Features
- **True Autonomy:** The agent is designed to be a self-sufficient entity, capable of learning, adapting, and evolving without constant human intervention.
- **Deep System Integration:** The agent has the tools to interact with and modify its own environment, from the filesystem to the kernel.
- **Self-Improvement:** The agent can autonomously create new tools and provision new capabilities from open-source repositories, allowing it to grow its own skillset over time.
- **Advanced Creative & Technical Tools:** Includes tools for reverse engineering, website generation, video creation, and even cross-compiling code for macOS.
- **Integrated Chromium Browser:** A dedicated, private browser instance for fast, reliable web research and data extraction.
- **Persistent Memory & Knowledge:** A dual-layer memory system, with a short-term episodic memory for actions and a long-term, compressed Knowledge Stack for storing vast amounts of learned information.
- **Enterprise-Grade CLI:** A beautiful, futuristic, and highly informative command-line interface that provides a rich user experience.
- **100% Local and Private:** All core components, including the LLM, run locally, ensuring data privacy and offline capability.

## Installation
1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have `git`, `docker`, and `python3` installed on your Debian-based system.
2.  **Run the Installer:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skyscope-sentinel/SkyscopeOS.git
    cd SkyscopeOS
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
    The script will handle all dependencies, set up the Python environment, download local LLM models, and configure the necessary services for autonomous operation.

## Usage
-   **Start the Orchestrator:** The installer provides the command to start the orchestrator service in the background.
-   **Interactive CLI:** The primary way to interact with the system is through the interactive CLI. After installation, open a new terminal (or run `source ~/.bashrc`) and run:
    ```bash
    skyscope
    ```
    This will launch the main interface, where you can chat with the agent and monitor its vital signs in real-time.

-   **REST API:** For programmatic interaction, the agent exposes a RESTful API. Send tasks via POST request to `http://localhost:8000/task`.

## Architecture
For a detailed breakdown of the system's architecture, please see `skyscope_os/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Safety
This is a highly advanced and experimental system. The agent has the ability to make significant changes to your system. While safeguards like the `IntegrityCritic` and `RollbackManager` are in place, human oversight is strongly recommended. Use at your own risk.
