# SkyScope Sentinel Intelligence Enterprise AGI OS

## Overview
SkyScope Sentinel is a revolutionary, fully autonomous, locally hosted AGI orchestration system designed to transform a standard Debian-based operating system into a first-of-its-kind self-aware, self-mutating AI OS. It integrates advanced AI agents, persistent multimodal episodic memory, dynamic tool creation, and sophisticated workflow orchestration, enabling deep system modifications, kernel patching, and proactive system management under human-in-the-loop governance.

## Features
- **Fully Local and Autonomous:** Completely offline-capable with no external dependencies.
- **Agentic Multi-Agent Teams:** Planner, developer, critic agents coordinate to self-optimize OS components.
- **Persistent Episodic & Vector Memory:** Self-built semantic memory for recall, learning, and reflection.
- **Workflow Automation:** Integrated n8n visual automation engine with AI-generated workflows and agents.
- **Browser Automation:** Multi-step automated browser control via Helium and Selenium.
- **System Integration:** Deep OS-level management including kernel, sysctl, systemd, bootloader configuration and enhancement.
- **Self-Mutating Code:** AI-driven self-reflective kernel module and driver patching, system configuration rewriting.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Interactive oversight and secure intervention capabilities.
- **Rebranding & Identity:** Fully renames and transforms the OS branding into the Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence Enterprise ASI AGI AI OS.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the SkyScope installer script.
2. Run the script on a Debian-based Linux system with root privileges.
3. The script sets up Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, pulls local LLM models, configures n8n and agent frameworks, and installs systemd services for persistent autonomy.

## Usage
- Interact with the system via the FastAPI REST endpoint for command execution and workflow provisioning.
- Define tasks, automate OS and development activities, and manage multi-agent workflows and memory queries through API or CLI.
- Supervise system changes via the human-in-the-loop prompts and logs stored persistently.

## Architecture
SkyScope Sentinel combines advanced frameworks:
- **SmolAgents, EvoAgentX, Swarms:** For multi-agent orchestration and reasoning.
- **LangGraph and LangChain:** For workflow graphing and LLM interaction.
- **SQLite + Sentence Transformers:** For building semantic episodic memory embedding.
- **Ollama:** For local LLM inference optimized for low footprint.
- **n8n:** For visual workflow automation and integration.
- **Helium and Selenium:** For robust browser automation tasks.

## Safety
All kernel and system-level modifications include automatic backups and rollback mechanisms. The orchestrator requires human approval to perform critical actions, minimizing risk of system failure.

## Contributing
This system is designed for extensibility. Contributions in AI-model improvements, memory algorithms, kernel enhancement modules, and workflow templates are welcome.

## License
Open-source and free for research and educational use. Commercial deployment requires consultation.
