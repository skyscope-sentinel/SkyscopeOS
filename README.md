# SkyScope Sentinel Intelligence Enterprise AGI OS

## Overview
SkyScope Sentinel is a revolutionary, fully autonomous, locally hosted AGI orchestration system designed to transform a standard Debian-based operating system into a first-of-its-kind self-aware, self-mutating AI OS. It integrates advanced AI agents, persistent multimodal episodic memory, dynamic tool creation, and sophisticated workflow orchestration, enabling deep system modifications, kernel patching, and proactive system management under human-in-the-loop governance.

## Features
- **Fully Local and Autonomous:** Completely offline-capable with no external dependencies for core operation.
- **Agentic Multi-Agent Teams:** Planner, developer, and critic agents coordinate to self-optimize OS components.
- **Persistent Episodic & Vector Memory:** Self-built semantic memory for recall, learning, and reflection.
- **Workflow Automation:** Integrated n8n visual automation engine with AI-generated workflows and agents.
- **Browser Automation:** Multi-step automated browser control via Helium and Selenium.
- **Deep System Integration:** Tools for managing files, kernel modules, system services, and executing shell commands.
- **Self-Mutating Code:** The agent can dynamically create new tools and modify its own source code, with safeguards in place.
- **Cloud & Docker Integration:** Tools for interacting with Google Drive, Gmail, Arxiv, and Docker containers.
- **Governance & Security:** Includes an Integrity Critic for static analysis of changes and a Rollback Manager for system snapshots.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Interactive CLI for direct command and oversight.

## Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skyscope-sentinel/SkyscopeOS.git
    cd SkyscopeOS
    ```
2.  **Run the Installer:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x skyscope
    ./skyscope
    ```
    The script will install all dependencies, set up the Python environment, download local LLM models, and configure the necessary `systemd` services.

## Usage
-   **Interactive CLI:** The primary way to interact with the system is through the interactive CLI. Simply open a new terminal and run:
    ```bash
    skyscope
    ```
    This will launch a beautiful, futuristic interface where you can chat with the agent, monitor system metrics, and see a history of your interactions.

-   **REST API:** The agent also exposes a RESTful API for programmatic interaction. You can send tasks to the agent by making a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/task`.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task": "Summarize the latest research on autonomous agents from Arxiv."}'
    ```

## Architecture
SkyScope Sentinel combines a suite of advanced open-source frameworks:
- **Agent Frameworks:** `SmolAgents`, `EvoAgentX`, `Swarms` for multi-agent orchestration.
- **LLM Inference:** `Ollama` for local, private LLM inference.
- **Memory:** A custom `SkyMemory` module using `SQLite` and `Sentence Transformers` for persistent, semantic memory.
- **Workflow Automation:** `n8n` for visual workflow creation and management.
- **Web & Cloud:** `Helium`, `Selenium`, and Google API libraries for external service integration.
- **CLI & API:** `prompt_toolkit`, `alive-progress`, and `FastAPI` for a modern user interface and robust API.

## Safety
All kernel and system-level modifications are designed to be used with caution. The `RollbackManager` can be used to create snapshots before performing critical actions. The agent's ability to modify its own code is restricted to its own directory for security. Human oversight via the CLI is the primary safety mechanism.

## Contributing
This system is designed for extensibility. Contributions in AI-model improvements, memory algorithms, kernel enhancement modules, and workflow templates are welcome.

## License
Open-source and free for research and educational use. Commercial deployment requires consultation.
