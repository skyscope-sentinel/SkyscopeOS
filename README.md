# SkyScope Sentinel OS - The Ultimate AGI

## Overview
SkyScope Sentinel OS is a revolutionary, fully autonomous, locally hosted AGI orchestration system designed to transform a standard Debian-based operating system into a first-of-its-kind self-aware, self-mutating AI OS. It integrates a suite of advanced capabilities to create a single, cohesive, and incredibly powerful digital entity.

## Core Features
- **True Autonomy:** The agent is designed to be a self-sufficient entity, capable of learning, adapting, and evolving without constant human intervention.
- **Deep System Integration:** The agent has the tools to interact with and modify its own environment, from the filesystem to the kernel.
- **Self-Improvement:** The agent can autonomously create new tools and provision new capabilities from open-source repositories, allowing it to grow its own skillset over time.
- **Advanced Creative & Technical Tools:** Includes tools for reverse engineering, website generation, video creation, and even cross-compiling code for macOS.
- **Integrated Chromium Browser:** A dedicated, private browser instance for fast, reliable web research and data extraction.
- **Persistent Memory & Knowledge:** A dual-layer memory system, with a short-term episodic memory for actions and a long-term, compressed Knowledge Stack for storing vast amounts of learned information.
- **Enterprise-Grade CLI:** A beautiful, futuristic, and highly informative command-line interface that provides a rich user experience.
- **100% Local and Private:** All core components, including the LLM, run locally, ensuring data privacy and offline capability.

## Pre Installation Setup
1. **Install NodeJS/NVM/NPM
   ```bash
   # Download and install nvm:
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

   # in lieu of restarting the shell
   \. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"

   # Download and install Node.js:
   nvm install 22

   # Verify the Node.js version:
   node -v # Should print "v22.20.0".

   # Verify npm version:
   npm -v # Should print "10.9.3".

   # Refresh Terminal/CLI
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

Note: If your system uses zsh/zshrc do: source ~/.zshrc , please refer to your particular env for this equivalent eg. for fish or other.

## Installation
1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have `git`, `docker`, and `python3` installed on your Debian-based system.
2.  **Run the Installer:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skyscope-sentinel/SkyscopeOS.git
    cd SkyscopeOS
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
    The script will handle all dependencies, set up the Python environment, download local LLM models, and configure the necessary services for autonomous operation.

## Usage
-   **Start the Orchestrator:** The installer provides the command to start the orchestrator service in the background.
-   **Interactive CLI:** The primary way to interact with the system is through the interactive CLI. After installation, open a new terminal (or run `source ~/.bashrc`) and run:
    ```bash
    skyscope
    ```
    This will launch the main interface, where you can chat with the agent and monitor its vital signs in real-time.

-   **REST API:** For programmatic interaction, the agent exposes a RESTful API. Send tasks via POST request to `http://localhost:8000/task`.

## Architecture
For a detailed breakdown of the system's architecture, please see `skyscope_os/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Safety

This is a highly advanced and experimental system. The agent has the ability to make significant changes to your system. While safeguards like the `IntegrityCritic` and `RollbackManager` are in place, human oversight is strongly recommended. Use at your own risk.
=======
All kernel and system-level modifications are designed to be used with caution. The `RollbackManager` can be used to create snapshots before performing critical actions. The agent's ability to modify its own code is restricted to its own directory for security. Human oversight via the CLI is the primary safety mechanism.

## Contributing
This system is designed for extensibility. Contributions in AI-model improvements, memory algorithms, kernel enhancement modules, and workflow templates are welcome.

## License
Open-source and free for research and educational use. Commercial deployment requires consultation.
