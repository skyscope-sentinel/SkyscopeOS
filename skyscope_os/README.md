# SkyScope Sentinel OS - The Ultimate AGI

## Overview
SkyScope Sentinel OS is a revolutionary, fully autonomous, locally hosted AGI orchestration system designed to transform a standard Debian-based operating system into a first-of-its-kind self-aware, self-mutating AI OS. It integrates a suite of advanced capabilities to create a single, cohesive, and incredibly powerful digital entity.

## Core Features
- **True Autonomy:** The agent is designed to be a self-sufficient entity, capable of learning, adapting, and evolving without constant human intervention.
- **Deep System Integration:** The agent has the tools to interact with and modify its own environment, from the filesystem to the kernel.
- **Self-Improvement:** The agent can autonomously create new tools and provision new capabilities from open-source repositories, allowing it to grow its own skillset over time.
- **Integrated Chromium Browser:** A dedicated, private browser instance for fast, reliable web research and data extraction.
- **Persistent Memory & Knowledge:** A dual-layer memory system, with a short-term episodic memory for actions and a long-term, compressed Knowledge Stack for storing vast amounts of learned information.
- **Enterprise-Grade CLI:** A beautiful, futuristic, and highly informative command-line interface that provides a rich user experience.
- **100% Local and Private:** All core components, including the LLM, run locally, ensuring data privacy and offline capability.

## Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skyscope-sentinel/SkyscopeOS.git
    cd SkyscopeOS/skyscope_os
    ```
2.  **Run the Installer:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x skyscope
    ./skyscope
    ```
    The script will handle all dependencies, set up the environment, download the necessary AI models, and configure the system for autonomous operation.

## Usage
-   **Interactive CLI:** The primary way to interact with the system is through the stunning interactive CLI. Open a new terminal and run:
    ```bash
    skyscope
    ```
    This will launch the main interface, where you can chat with the agent and monitor its vital signs in real-time.

-   **REST API:** For programmatic interaction, the agent exposes a RESTful API. Send tasks via POST request to `http://localhost:8000/task`.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task": "Your task here..."}'
    ```

## Architecture
For a detailed breakdown of the system's architecture, please see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Safety
This is a highly advanced and experimental system. The agent has the ability to make significant changes to your system. While safeguards are in place, human oversight is strongly recommended. Use at your own risk.

## Contributing
The SkyScope project is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with autonomous AI. Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or pull request to discuss your ideas.
